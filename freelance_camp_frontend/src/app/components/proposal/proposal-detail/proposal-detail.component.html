            <p>Hi {{proposal.customer}}</p>

            <p>It was a pleasure getting to meet with you and review your project requirements, I believe it is a great fit
                for the types of applications that I build out. Please feel free to check out some of my past projects
                <a href="{{proposal.portfolio_url}}">here</a>.</p>

            <p>To succesfully build out the application I will be utilizang {{proposal.tools}}, and...</p>
            <p>Ensuring that you are fully informed is one of my tio priorities...</p>
            <p>To acoplish the project and meet the requirements that we discussed, I am estimating that it will take {{proposal.estimated_hours}}
                hours in development time to complete. The project should take {{proposal.weeks_to_complete}} weeks to complete
                and with my hourly rate of {{proposal.hourly_rate}}/hour, the estimated total will be {{proposal.hourly_rate
                * proposal.estimated_hours| currency: 'EUR':true:'.0'}}.
